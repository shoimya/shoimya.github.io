                <h2>Computer Scientist | Software Developer | Full-stack Web Developer</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my website! I am Shoimya Chowdhury, a highly skilled and motivated computer scientist with a passion for software development and full-stack web development. With a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Michigan State University, I bring a strong technical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and a collaborative mindset to every project.
                    Throughout my academic journey, I have excelled in courses such as Algorithms and Data Structures, Machine Learning, and Object-Oriented Programming. My technical skills encompass a wide range of programming languages, including Python, C++, and JavaScript, as well as proficiency in web development technologies such as HTML5, CSS, and Flask. I am also experienced in utilizing frameworks and tools like Docker, ASP.NET CORE, and Microsoft Azure.
                    In terms of relevant experience, I had the opportunity to work as a Full-stack Developer with RPM Freight Systems, where I successfully led a team in designing, developing, and deploying an order management system. Through the implementation of machine learning techniques, such as Spectral Clustering and Principal Component Analysis, we optimized the shipping process by 43%. Additionally, I have gained valuable insights as a Web Development and Business Research Intern at DataSoft Systems Bangladesh Ltd, where I conducted extensive research and contributed to the development of a trading platform.
                    I have also participated in notable projects, including Hate Speech Recognition and NFT Trading Platform, where I collaborated with teams to leverage advanced technologies and deliver exceptional results. Furthermore, as part of a cohesive team, I contributed to the development of an engaging platform game called Sparty Gnome, showcasing my skills in object-oriented programming and version control.
                    With a strong foundation in software development, proficiency in full-stack web development, and a passion for leveraging cutting-edge technologies, I am excited to embark on new challenges and contribute to innovative projects. I am dedicated to continuous learning, staying up-to-date with industry trends, and delivering high-quality solutions.
